# Comparison of Amazon EBS and Amazon S3

## **Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

### Overview
- **Type**: Block storage designed for use with Amazon EC2 instances.
- **Use Case**: Provides high-performance, low-latency storage for applications like databases, file systems, and transactional workloads.

### Key Features
1. **Type of Storage**: Block-level storage (similar to a hard drive).
2. **Scalability**: Limited to 16 TiB per volume but allows multiple volumes to be attached to an instance.
3. **Performance**:
   - Supports **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)**, **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)**, and **Magnetic HDD (st1, sc1)**.
   - High IOPS and low latency for transactional workloads.
4. **Durability and Availability**:
   - Data is replicated within a single Availability Zone.
   - Snapshots provide data backup and recovery across AZs.
5. **Integration**: Must be attached to EC2 instances for access.
6. **Cost**: Charged for provisioned storage capacity.

### Best Use Cases
- Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Boot volumes for EC2 instances.
- Low-latency applications requiring high IOPS.

## **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)**

### Overview
- **Type**: Object storage for unstructured data.
- **Use Case**: Stores large amounts of data with high durability and availability, accessible over the internet or programmatically.

### Key Features
1. **Type of Storage**: Object-level storage (data stored as objects with metadata and keys).
2. **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited storage capacity.
3. **Performance**:
   - High throughput, suitable for big data and analytics workloads.
   - Optimized for write-once, read-many use cases.
4. **Durability and Availability**:
   - 99.999999999% (11 9’s) durability.
   - Data is replicated across multiple AZs in a region.
5. **Integration**: Accessed via APIs, AWS CLI, SDKs, or web interface.
6. **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go for storage, data transfer, and requests.

### Best Use Cases
- Storing backups, archives, and static website content.
- Data lakes and big data analytics.
- Media storage and content distribution.

## **Key Differences**

1. **Storage Type**:
   - **EBS**: Block storage for EC2, like a virtual hard drive.
   - **S3**: Object storage for storing large datasets with metadata.

2. **Scalability**:
   - **EBS**: Limited to 16 TiB per volume but attachable to multiple instances.
   - **S3**: Unlimited storage capacity.

3. **Performance**:
   - **EBS**: Low latency, high IOPS for transactional workloads.
   - **S3**: High throughput, optimized for large-scale data processing.

4. **Durability and Redundancy**:
   - **EBS**: Data is replicated within a single AZ; snapshots add durability.
   - **S3**: Data is replicated across multiple AZs by default.

5. **Cost**:
   - **EBS**: Charged for provisioned capacity, regardless of usage.
   - **S3**: Pay-as-you-go for storage, requests, and data transfer.

## **Interview Tips**

- Highlight **EBS** for high-performance, low-latency storage attached to EC2.
- Mention **S3** as the go-to choice for scalable object storage and data lakes.
- Discuss real-world use cases (e.g., S3 for backup vs. EBS for running databases).
- Explain differences in **durability, scalability, and performance**.
